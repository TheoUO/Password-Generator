## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://theouo.github.io/Password-Generator/)

For this project, I create a randomized password generator that allows the user to retrieve a variety of passwords which include numbers, letters, and special characters.

## Usage 

This site is quite easy to navigate through. First select "Generate Password", then an alert pops up whereby you will be asked a series of question before you are provided a randomized password.

## Learning Points 

I feel much more confident with the use of functions and loops as working on this project helped to fine-tune my ability in them. I have a better understanding on Javascript methods and their uses!
